# Hybrid-Simulation
Hybrid simulation scripts for Matlab/Simscape


This package includes four stabilization technique simulations for hybrid simulations: passivity (velocity modification), passivity (force modification), H-infinity control, and adaptive control). 

Each simulation has an associated run file and Simulink simulation.
